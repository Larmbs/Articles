# Song Streaming On a Budget
I listen to music often and using music streaming like Spotify, Apple Music, or Sound Cloud can be annoying especially with their frequent ads. One solution Ive devised for my dilemma is to use third party software and download music through public means. Sources like Youtube, and Youtube Music offer streaming services tap able through third party programs. Ive found using open source tools like [SpotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube), and [freyr-js](https://github.com/miraclx/freyr-js) have freed me from monthly subscriptions and ads common amongst other services.

## How To 
First thing to do is download the latest version of Python, if you have it already make sure it is up to date, else follow this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) or check out the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then you must follow the setup guide for [SpotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader). I find this the easiest to use, while it is missing some songs, it offers a convenient CLI. 

After doing so set up a folder on your computer, this will be where you store all your songs. Next open up a terminal within that folder and use the CLI. Then if you have followed everything correctly above type "spotdl 'Youtube Music Link', then you should see a progress bar bellow (PS. use "spotdl --help" for more information on commands).

Download however many songs you'd like.

Now choose your favorite cloud storage provider, whether that be [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [Drop Box](https://www.dropbox.com/) it does not matter. Then transfer all those downloaded songs into your drive in some folder. 

Finally install on of these two apps, [GoPlayer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goplayer-cloud-music-player/id1159282786) or [Cloud Beats](https://www.cloudbeatsapp.com/). Then look for where you can hookup your cloud storage provider to the app. 

Then enjoy.
